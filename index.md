## Welcome to IntACT Project

The aim of the project is to develop a computational system that will assist clinicians with the diagnosis of ILDs while avoiding the dangerous, expensive and time-consuming invasive biopsies. The system will provide a computerized differential diagnosis, based on radiological data and clinical/biochemical markers and will focus on the discrimination between the IPF and the NSIP while keeping a generic architecture that could be expanded to most types of ILDs. The appropriate interpretation of the available radiological data combined with clinical/biochemical information can provide reliable diagnosis able to improve the diagnostic accuracy of the clinicians.

This research is carried out within the framework of the INTACT research project, supported by Bern University Hospital, “Inselspital” and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) under Grant 156511.
